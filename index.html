team

team name no help

legacy

many people past, now

test days here - made sense

definition looked for

not either dev or ops

develop own tools

almighty production code

not good definition

bias to operations

no ownership
---
#Automation Center
???
join after hire

develop and operate

AC - automate things

high volume
---
#Part-time job
???
full time develop and operate

mostly develop

operate office

legacy - hard to maintain

operate only office

pass to DevOps

they tired

it's their job
---
#Hiccup
???
never more or less messages

development stopped

big changes

no risk taking

time-zone

ops own ac
---
#WAT
???
ops operate

devs develop

no owner

manual intervention to change

temporary takeover
---
#Pain
???
feel the pain

manual interventions

manual prio of jobs

jobs failing

communication errors

they were not lazy

they had other things to do

direct sql

wake up - rely - no pressure

tools

got to know

automate

good night of sleep

ownership is key

every team own ops

learned:

dev is responsibility

ops is responsibility
---
#Custom Development
???
new team

custom development single customer

very focused

detailed specs

new infrastructure

new architecture

#Where do we start?
???
We were smart enough to know that we didn’t really want to invent anything new here.

We also knew that we needed such flexibility and autonomy that our internal infrastructure could not offer us.

We didn’t have to think much, as we had the possibility to simply copy what some of the other teams were already doing and

build on Heroku and our company homebrew Node JS microframework, called the Boar Stack.
---
No idea wat I’m doing
???
We didn’t have experience with Node JS.

Like - at all.

Or much with client side javascript.

But we had the Force.
---
Boar stack
???
This stack is something that the company JavaScript community maintains and develops,

and is the result of many hours of work done by the different teams.

First these were some packages of a single team, extracted following the DRY principle - do not repeat yourself

and it slowly got out of control, and it now spans multiple teams.
---
Integrated
???
Actually the stack involves more than just Yet Another NodeJS Framework™.

Other than the backend and frontend framework and knowhow, we got a whole integrated package,

including a testing framework, a deployment tool, logging and monitoring infrastucture, some database engines

and did I mention the knowhow?

You probably think now that we are developing lots of tools unnecessarily, but this is not true - most of the components were proven, ready solutions and services created by others.

The reason I include them here is that we as a company had to learn how to apply them, and our team didn't have to take this effort.
---
It’s all right there
???
So the biggest advantage of the stack came from the fact that it was all there,

not only the parts included in the nodejs package and it’s dependencies,

but in the head of some great developers.

And it was there waiting for us to use it.

The present is how most of the newly developed services look like. Here, as you can see I’m talking about services. These are mostly feature services, which means that they are not as focused as a microservice, but are sized in a way that a single team can operate them. Most of these are operated on external platforms, with only some hosted inside.
---
Getting the feel of it
???
speed up

communicate

return
---
The future
???
As I mentioned, after the challenges of doing Custom Development I was again offered part in a new team.
---
Exploring new horizons
???
This time the challenge is to create a new product out of the woods.

The product is based on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence - some interesting buzzwords for you

New technology
